Space Dust Racing - arcade vehicle re-creation:
===================================
- suspension
	+ raycast from each corner towards ground (choose a length)
			this is the spring
	+ if raycast doesn't hit
			nothing needs doing (physics can takeover e.g. gravity)
	+ if hits
			check how compressed spring is (scalar)
				e.g. how long is the raycast from 1 - 0
					0 being fully extended, 1 being where raycast started
			force upwards along suspension depending on compression ratio
				more compressed means more force
				spring compression is a scalar for the force
	+ raycast resuls to cache
			compression ratio (0 - 1)
			surface hit point (v3)
			surface hit normal (v3)
			
- accelerating & braking
	+ apply forward/backward force to vehicle
	+ when moving project direction onto road plane
			get average of all hit normals from the wheel raycasts
			this stops vehicle launching into air/ground when car is tilted up or down
	+ apply move force slightly lower than center of mass and towards front of vehicle
			this helps tilt car forwards & back as it moves
			
- turning
	+ apply torque to left/right input direction

- traction
	+ apply force in opposite direction to velocity but ONLY on the sides
		can be done by projecting (dot product) velocity onto sideways unit vector (v3.right) and then applying that as a force in opposite direction (towards vehicle.) Maybe with a scalar too to tweak it.
